# PPS-18-PrologZ

PrologZ is a DSL which imitates the core features of Prolog, to provide a direct support for logic programming in Scala.

This project is made using Scalaz, a library for functional programming that complements the Scala standard library.

What I studied about Scalaz and the details of this project implementation are available in [`report.pdf`](report.pdf).
